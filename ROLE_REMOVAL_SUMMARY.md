### **1. User Model (`src/models/user.model.js`)**
- ❌ Removed `role` field with enum `['student', 'instructor']`
- ❌ Removed default value `'student'`
- ✅ User model now only contains: `username`, `email`, `fullname`, `password`, `avatar`, `coverImage`, `domain`, `refreshToken`, `watchHistory`

### **2. Registration Form (`src/views/loginregister.ejs`)**
- ❌ Removed role dropdown with "Student" and "Instructor" options
- ✅ Simplified registration form to essential fields only

### **3. Registration JavaScript (`public/javascripts/loginregister.js`)**
- ❌ Removed `role` variable extraction from form
- ❌ Removed `role` from API request body
- ✅ Registration now sends: `username`, `email`, `password`, `fullname`

### **4. User Controller (`src/controllers/user.controller.js`)**
- ❌ Removed `role` from request body destructuring
- ❌ Removed `role` field from user creation
- ❌ Removed `role: role || 'student'` default assignment
- ✅ Users created with domain-based validation only

### **5. Test Files**
- ❌ Removed `role` from all test registration requests
- ❌ Updated `test-registration.js` - all 3 test scenarios
- ✅ Tests now work without role field

### **6. Documentation**
- ❌ Removed role from manual testing guide
- ❌ Removed role from API documentation  
- ❌ Updated domain system README
- ✅ All docs reflect simplified registration

## ✅ What Remains Clean

### **JWT Tokens**
- ✅ No role in access tokens - only `_id`, `email`, `username`, `fullname`
- ✅ Authentication system unaffected

### **Admin/Owner Roles**
- ✅ Admin model still has role field (for admin functionality)
- ✅ Owner model still has role field (for owner functionality)
- ✅ Only USER role field was removed

### **Database**
- ✅ Existing users with role field will continue to work
- ✅ New users registered without role field
- ✅ No migration needed - backward compatible

## 🧪 Testing Results

### **Registration Now Requires Only:**
```json
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@testuniversity.edu", 
  "password": "password123",
  "fullname": "John Doe"
}
```

### **What's Validated:**
- ✅ Email domain must be approved
- ✅ Username must be unique
- ✅ Email must be unique
- ✅ All fields required
- ❌ No role selection needed

### **Registration Flow:**
1. User fills simplified form (no role dropdown)
2. System extracts domain from email
3. System validates domain is approved
4. User created with domain field only
5. Success/error popup shown
